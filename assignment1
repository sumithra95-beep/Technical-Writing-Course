In the latter situation, the writer may also be called upon to create the
storyboard for the training film/video for the procedure. The result in each case
will be very different. Quite often, technical documents have more than one
audience (such as a primary, secondary, and even teriary audience), and will
thus need to serve more than one level of technical expertise.
Technical writers often work as part of teams. In most cases, after the
documentation is written using a desktop publishing tool or a help authoring
tool, it is normally reviewed for accuracy by one or more "Subject Matter
Experts" (SMEs).
1.1 Technical Writing
Technical Writing, a subset of technical communication, is used in fields as

The entire point of Technical Writing (Information Development) is to
communicate and disseminate useful information. Technical communications
